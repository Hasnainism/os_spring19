INORDER TO COMPILE MULTIPLE SOURCE FILES WE USE AN AUTOMATED TOOL KNOWN AS 'make'.
'make' SEARCHES FOR A FILE NAMED 'makefile' IN THE GIVEN DIRECTORY & RUNS ALL THE 
COMMANDS PRE-DEFINED IN THE FILE.
THIS IN TURN SOLVES THE HASSLE OF RUNNING MULTIPLE LINES OF CODE TO COMPILE, BY 
JUST WRITING IT ONCE IN THE MAKEFILE.

HOW TO RUN 'make' IN THE TERMINAL.

$make
